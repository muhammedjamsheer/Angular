### Angular Data Binding
The data binding in Angular can be broadly classified into two groups. One way binding or two-way binding

#### One way binding
In one way binding data flows from one direction. Either from view to component or from component to view.

#### Interpolation
Data flows from the component to the DOM.We use curly braces for interpolation.

Interpolation syntax
{{ templateExpression }}
